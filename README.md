# Final project

Minting and Burning a coin using solidity.

## Description

In this project we have used functions and variables as learned from the different modules using solidity.The main goal of this project is to create your token on ethereum blockchain and learn basic functions such as minting and burning the tokens and also writing conditional statements to reduce basic errors.

### Program Execution
To run this program, we use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., Project.sol).
After writing the code according to the instructions we can test the code using the left tab showing "deploy". User can mint some coins and check the total supply and balances.
